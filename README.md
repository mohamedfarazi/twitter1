This is my 2nd Ember application as I continue to learn about this framework.

The files are plain HTML, CSS, and JS. Clone the repo and fire it up to see it working. You'll have to disable same origin policy in Chrome to see it full working, since it's connecting to a JSON endpoint at a different server that I setup on Heroku.


To disable same origin policy temporarily:
==========================================
For Mac, open Terminal and run:

$ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security
For Linux run:

$ google-chrome --disable-web-security
Also if you're trying to access local files for dev purposes like AJAX or JSON, you can use this flag too.

-â€“allow-file-access-from-files
For PC go into the command prompt and go into the folder where Chrome.exe is and type

chrome.exe --disable-web-security
